The application is a timed quiz on JavaScript and coding fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge the user can gauge there progress compared to there peers

What used to complete the project was I used windows API's, Traverse DOM, A time interval, appended elements, used event listeners, data atributes and stored (objects, and arrays turned into strings) and retrived from in local storage for code use. I also recived help from tutors, BSC and in class time.

The app works:
I click the start button = Event Listener
A timer starts and I am presented with a question = Timer interval and for loop that goes throught the questions
I answer a question it will say if its right or wrong = append method
I am presented with another question = if statment through the for loop
I answer a question incorrectly 
5 seconds is subtracted from the clock = if/else statment
All questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 = Time Inverval to stop at 0
The game is over and box will pop up to type Initals = Append method
I can save my initials and my score = Using local storage
